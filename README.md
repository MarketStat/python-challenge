**Purpose**

The purpose of the attached code in PyBank is to analyze financial budget data and find relevant changes and summarize the available data over several years. 

The purpose of the code in PyPoll is to analyze election results and provide summary data of each candidate and provide the winner.

**Description**

**PyBank**

Analysis was achieved by reviewing the data types in the CSV and creating several variables that computed the change over several months by looping through the rows of data and determining which month had the largest increase and decrease and what the average change was over the 86 months.

**PyPoll**

Analysis was completed by using a loop to sum the total votes cast in the election and summing the votes for each candidate. By adding the the candidates and votes to lists I created a dictionary using the candidates as the key and the votes as the value to search each pair and determine the total votes and percentage and finding the max value of the dictionary to determine the winner.

**References**

I've worked extensively with dictionaries in VBA in my previous work, I used the below attached to help achieve the analysis as well as in-class slides and
